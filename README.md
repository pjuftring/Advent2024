# Solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 using Haskell

I use this month to learn Haskell. (Usually, I'm more of an imperative guy, ðŸ¦€) Other solutions are usually more compact but (at least for me) quite hard to decipher. I try to make everything a bit more readable even though it makes my solutions quite verbose (or at least I'm telling myself that this is the reason).

Also, my goal is to only use the `base` package. So no `ByteString`s or `Map`s or `RegExp`.
